## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18.0.0 or higher

- OpenAI API key

- Modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, or Safari recommended)

- Git

### Environment Setup

1\. Clone the repository:

```bash

git clone https://github.com/somkuwaryash/data-duck.git

cd dataduck

```

2\. Install dependencies:

```bash

npm install

# or

yarn install

```

3\. Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory:

```env

NEXT_PUBLIC_OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key

```

4\. Start the development server:

```bash

npm run dev

# or

yarn dev

```

### Important Notes

- The application requires a significant amount of browser resources due to Pyodide

- Initial loading might take time as it downloads the Python environment

- Ensure you have a stable internet connection for AI features

## 🔧 Configuration

### OpenAI API

- Set up an OpenAI account and obtain an API key

- Configure the key in your environment variables

- Adjust the model settings in `src/utils/openai.ts` if needed

### Python Environment

The application uses Pyodide for running Python code in the browser. Key configurations:

- Default Python packages: numpy, pandas, matplotlib, scipy

- Custom package installation available through Pyodide

- Memory management considerations for browser-based execution

## 📚 Documentation

### Architecture

DataDuck follows a modular architecture:

- **Frontend**: Next.js with React components

- **AI Layer**: OpenAI integration and RAG implementation

- **Data Processing**: Browser-based Python execution

- **Storage**: LocalForage for persistent storage

### Key Components

- `ChatInterface`: Natural language interaction

- `CodeAndConsole`: Python code execution

- `VisualizationArea`: Data visualization

- `DocumentProcessing`: RAG document handling

### State Management

- React Context for global state

- LocalForage for persistent storage

- Custom hooks for complex state logic

📖 Usage Guide
--------------

### 1\. Data Analysis Interface

Data Preview
------------

1.  Navigate to the `/analyze` page
2.  The left panel shows your uploaded datasets
3.  Click on a dataset to:
    -   View a preview of the data
    -   See basic dataset information
    -   Load it for analysis

AI Chat Interface
-----------------

1.  With a dataset selected, use the chat interface to analyze your data
2.  Example queries:

    plaintext

    Copy

    `- "Show me the basic statistics of this dataset"
    - "Calculate the average values by category"
    - "Create a visualization of the trends"`

3.  The AI will:
    -   Generate appropriate Python code
    -   Execute the code automatically
    -   Show results and visualizations
    -   Provide explanations of the analysis

Code and Console
----------------

-   View generated Python code in the Code tab
-   See execution results in the Console
-   Copy code snippets for reuse
-   Clear outputs as needed

### 2\. Document Management (RAG)

Document Upload
---------------

1.  Go to the `/documents` page
2.  Upload supported document types:
    -   PDF files
    -   Text files (.txt)
    -   Word documents (.docx)
3.  View uploaded documents in the document list

Document Processing
-------------------

1.  Select documents for processing
2.  Wait for embedding generation
3.  Track processing status in the progress bar
4.  Processed documents are ready for RAG queries

Using RAG Mode
--------------

1.  Toggle RAG mode in the chat interface
2.  Ask questions about your documents:

    plaintext

    Copy

    `- "Summarize the key points from the documents"
    - "What do the documents say about [specific topic]?"
    - "Compare the information between documents"`

3.  The system will:
    -   Search relevant document sections
    -   Generate context-aware responses
    -   Provide source references

### 💡 Tips & Best Practices

1.  **Data Analysis**
    -   Keep datasets under 100MB for optimal performance
    -   Be specific in your questions
    -   Use clear business metrics in queries
    -   Save important results using the export function
2.  **Document Analysis**
    -   Process documents before starting RAG queries
    -   Use focused questions for better results
    -   Check document processing status before querying
    -   Clear irrelevant documents to improve performance
3.  **Troubleshooting Common Issues**

| Issue | Solution |
| --- | --- |
| Slow data loading | Reduce dataset size |
| Failed document processing | Try re-uploading the document |
| RAG mode not working | Ensure documents are processed |
| Execution errors | Check dataset format |
